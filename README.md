**Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning**


We can now state that one of the main problems we deal with on every day is fraud. This mostly occurs in the banking, insurance, and online retail industries, among others. Resolving these types of problems has always been a major undertaking for risk analysts and fraud detectors alike. Though the advancement of technology is accelerating, fraud is expanding at a faster rate. Fraudulent actions come in many forms, such as: 
• Tampering with real cards. 
• Making fictitious playing cards.
• Credit cards that are lost. 
• Deceptive telephone marketing.

**Statement of the project problem:**

Finding an option for the early detection of the fraudulent activities would be very helpful. This might be difficult for any organization to detect each fraudulent activity because they can see thousands of such activities occurring frequently. The main goal of this project is to detect fraud using machine learning as this process makes helpful for the organizations to solve such issues.


**Objectives of the study:**

After cleaning the data and extracting the required columns in the dataset I’m going to check the number of fraudulent activities. In one of the columns, we can 0’s and 1’s where the 0 represents non fraudulent activities and 1’s represent the fraudulent activities. This column helps us to work on finding the accuracy using different machine learning algorithms.


**About the dataset:**

I have chosen this dataset from Kaggle. This dataset consisted around 2lakh records from which I have taken 65536 records for my convenience. The dataset has 31 columns where the time, amount and class are the important columns and all others are different attributes contributing to these columns which are taken from V1 to V28.


**Research analysis:**

I've always been curious about how fraud operates and the strategies used by those attempting to stop it. After the data is in the right shape, I will begin by cleaning it, and then I will do some exploratory data analysis. Building a machine learning model using the data is the next action I would like to take. The data will first be divided into training and test sets, after which I will run the logistic regression technique to get the accuracy score.


**Data analysis:**

I have uploaded a pynb file where we can see all the analysis clearly.


**Conclusion:**

By performing machine learning algorithms, I can conclude by finding and comparing the accuracy from logistic regression. Here, using python helps in providing the visualizations of various attributes.
